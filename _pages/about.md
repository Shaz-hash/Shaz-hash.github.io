Iâ€™m a final-year BS CS student (aspiring for Ph.D.) at the Lahore University of Management and Sciences. My research interests span the domains of Networked Systems, and I am particularly drawn to the challenges of constructing efficient, scalable, and secure network systems within diverse distributed applications, each presenting its unique set of constraints and tradeoffs. To this end, I also intend to rethink many already-existing abstractions that allow us to isolate these problems because, sometimes, the abstractions we synthesize can limit our perspective and discourage unconventional, innovative ways of thinking.

Currently, under the supervision of my supervisor, Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi, and an external collaborator, Dr. Fawad Ahmed, an acquaintance and I are working on MultiEdge-SLAM, which initially began as a course project. The objective is to extend Edge-SLAM (built on ORB-SLAM2) for Multi-Access Edge Computing via pre-emptive state migration, empowering smartphones with limited computational capabilities to participate in SLAM algorithms, thereby enabling emerging AR/VR 5G applications.

In my Junior year, I also joined in as a co-author on an extended submission for CellClone, a successor to Neutrino that addressed its shortcomings regarding fault tolerance. Supervised by Mukhtiar Ahmed, I led a key aspect of the expansion, which involves reimagining Control Plane Functions (CPFs) to achieve a more ecologically valid distribution of edge sites and evaluating accordingly. Through this evaluation, I demonstrated the tradeoff between latency and fault tolerance that network operators can optimize for their constraints.
