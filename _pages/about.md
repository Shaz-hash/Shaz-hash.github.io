I am a final-year BS CS student at the Lahore University of Management and Sciences, aspiring for a Ph.D. My research interests encompass Distributed and Operating Systems, with a particular focus on addressing the challenges of constructing efficient and secure distributed systems while emphasizing inclusivity and correctness. My primary focus lies in developing simplistic consensus algorithms to meet these demands.

Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of Dr. Zafar Ayyub Qazi and co-supervised by Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi. Together with my research partner, we are investigating the effects of Federated Learning on Android devices. What initially started as a course project has evolved into a study focused on comprehending how the expanding applications of Federated Learning contribute to heightened resource consumption at the kernel level, negatively impacting user experience and the well-being of the device.

In the summer after my Sophomore year, I interned with Dr. Zartash Afzal Uzmi in Blockchain where I concentrated on developing a fair "Reputation System" on Ethereum. I contributed by creating a transparent reputation quantification protocol to deter collusion between sellers and buyers. Furthermore, ​​to assess the protocol's effectiveness, I conducted multiple simulations involving various collusion attack scenarios.
